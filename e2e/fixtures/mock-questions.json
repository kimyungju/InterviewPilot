    "question": "What is the difference between REST and GraphQL APIs, and when would you choose one over the other?",
    "answer": "REST uses resource-based URLs with standard HTTP methods and returns fixed data structures. GraphQL uses a single endpoint where clients specify exactly what data they need. Choose REST for simple CRUD operations with well-defined resources, and GraphQL when clients need flexible data fetching or when you want to reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data."

    "question": "Explain how you would implement authentication in a web application. What are the key security considerations?",
    "answer": "I would implement authentication using JWTs or session-based auth with secure cookies. Key considerations include: using HTTPS, hashing passwords with bcrypt, implementing CSRF protection, setting secure and httpOnly cookie flags, adding rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks, and implementing proper session invalidation on logout."

    "question": "Describe the concept of database indexing. When should you add an index and what are the trade-offs?",
    "answer": "Database indexing creates a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations. You should add indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses. Trade-offs include: increased storage space, slower write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) since indexes must be updated, and the need for periodic maintenance."

  {
    "question": "How do you handle error handling and logging in a production application?",
    "answer": "I implement a layered error handling strategy: use try-catch blocks at appropriate levels, create custom error classes for different error types, implement global error handlers/middleware, and use structured logging with different log levels. For production, I use centralized logging services, set up error monitoring and alerting, and ensure sensitive information is never logged."

  {
    "question": "What is your approach to writing testable code? Give an example of how you would refactor tightly-coupled code.",
    "answer": "I follow SOLID principles, particularly dependency injection and single responsibility. For example, if a function directly calls a database and an API, I would extract those dependencies into interfaces/parameters that can be mocked during testing. This allows unit testing without real infrastructure, making tests faster and more reliable."
